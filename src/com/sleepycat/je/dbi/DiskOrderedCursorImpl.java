/**
 * This class implements the DiskOrderedCursor. When an instance is
 * constructed, a Producer Thread is created which runs a DiskOrderedScanner
 * against the DiskOrderedCursor's Database.  The callback for the
 * DiskOrderedScanner takes key/data byte arrays that are passed to it, and
 * then place those entries on a BlockingQueue which is shared between the
 * Producer Thread and the application thread.  When the application calls
 * getNext(), it simply takes an entry off the queue and hands it to the
 * caller.  The entries on the queue are simple KeyAndData structs which hold
 * byte[]'s for the key (and optional) data.  A special instance of KeyAndData
 * is used to indicate that the cursor scan has finished.
 *
 * The consistency guarantees are documented in the public javadoc for
 * DiskOrderedCursor, and are based on the use of DiskOrderedScanner (see its
 * javadoc for details).
 *
 * If the cleaner is operating concurrently with the DiskOrderedScanner, then
 * it is possible for a file to be deleted and a not-yet-processed LSN (i.e.
 * one which has not yet been returned to the user) might be pointing to that
 * deleted file.  Therefore, we must disable file deletion (but not cleaner
 * operation) during the DOS.
