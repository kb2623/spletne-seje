/**
 * Utilities class for analyzing and working with CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) characters. The main purpose of this
 * class is to assist in figuring out how many terminal columns a character (and in extension, a String) takes up. The
 * main issue is that while most latin (and latin-related) character can be trusted to consume one column in the
 * terminal, CJK characters tends to take two, partly due to the square nature of the characters but mostly due to the
 * fact that they require most space to distinguish.
