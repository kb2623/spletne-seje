/** <p>ConnectionManager interface provides a hook for the resource adapter to
 *  pass a connection request to the application server. 
 *
 *  <p>An application server provides implementation of the ConnectionManager
 *  interface. This implementation is not specific to any particular type of
 *  the resource adapter or connection factory interface.
 *
 *  <p>The ConnectionManager implementation delegates to the application 
 *  server to enable latter to provide quality of services (QoS) - security,
 *  connection pool management, transaction management and error 
 *  logging/tracing. 
 *
 *  <p>An application server implements these services in a generic manner, 
 *  independent of any resource adapter and EIS specific mechanisms. The 
 *  connector architecture does not specify how an application server 
 *  implements these services; the implementation is specific to an 
 *  application server.
 *
 *  <p>After an application server hooks-in its services, the connection 
 *  request gets delegated to a ManagedConnectionFactory instance either 
 *  for the creation of a new physical connection or for the matching of 
 *  an already existing physical connection.
 *
 *  <p>An implementation class for ConnectionManager interface is
 *  required to implement the <code>java.io.Serializable</code> interface.
 *
 *  <p>In the non-managed application scenario, the ConnectionManager 
 *  implementation class can be provided either by a resource adapter (as
 *  a default ConnectionManager implementation) or by application 
 *  developers. In both cases, QOS can be provided as components by third
 *  party vendors.</p>
